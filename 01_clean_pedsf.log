. * SEER Medicare clean up
. * Eric Chow, 04-27-2017
. *
. * opens pedsf_small.dta which appended the 6 files, and kept only some vars
. * but no other data transformations done (some string to text)
. *
. * do the Things from Baiyu's file. ie: 
. *    1. get only those w firdt dx == lung cancer, not just any dx of LC (use SITERWHO, seq1
> =00|01)
. *    2. keep if dgn in 2000-2013
. *    3. must be enerolled in medicar part A & B, & not in HMO in mnth of dgn
. *    4. keep only dgn from 2000-2013 - compare w SEER*medicare website
