. * Eric Chow, 04-27-2017
. *
. * opens pedsf_small.dta which appended the 6 files, and kept only some vars
. * but no other data transformations done (some string to text)
. *
. * do the Things from Baiyu's file. ie: 
. *    1. get only those w firdt dx == lung cancer, not just any dx of LC (use SITERWHO
> , seq1=00|01)
. *    2. keep if dgn in 2000-2013
. *    3. must be enerolled in medicar part A & B, & not in HMO in mnth of dgn
. *    4. keep only dgn from 2000-2013 - compare w SEER*medicare website

variable reg not constant within patient_id
    Your data are currently long.  You are performing a reshape wide.  You typed
    something like

        . reshape wide a b, i(patient_id) j(seq_lc)

    There are variables other than a, b, patient_id, seq_lc in your data.  They must
    be constant within patient_id because that is the only way they can fit into wide
    data without loss of information.

    The variable or variables listed above are not constant within patient_id.
    Perhaps the values are in error.  Type reshape error for a list of the problem
    observations.

    Either that, or the values vary because they should vary, in which case you must
    either add the variables to the list of xij variables to be reshaped, or drop
    them.

(note: j = 1 2 3 4)

i (patient_id) indicates the top-level grouping such as subject id.
j (seq_lc) indicates the subgrouping such as time.
